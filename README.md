# Wrapped Beta Gaussian

## Implementation
Implementation of Wrapped Beta Gaussian distribution in PyTorch.
The `wbgauss` folder containt the implementation of Wrapped Beta Gaussian distribution:
- `wbgauss/sphere.py` contains implementation of Wrapped Beta Gaussian distribution on the sphere with two parametrizations: pole and embedded;
- `wbgauss/special_orthogonal.py` contains implementation of Wrapped Beta Gaussian distribution on the special orthogonal group.


## Installation
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Experiments
`experiments/` folder contains code for experiments from the paper. To run the experiments, you need to install the package first. Experiments can be runned from the subfolders of `experiments/` folder.
